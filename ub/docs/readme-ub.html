  <b>I. <a NAME="general"></a>GENERAL OVERVIEW</b>
  <p>Unfinished Business (&quot;UB&quot;) is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.&nbsp; It is designed to restore many of the cut items, quests, and encounters from the game's final release, as well as try to tie up some of the &quot;loose ends.&quot;&nbsp; As usual, UB should be compatible with most other WeiDU-based mods, and should be installed after all official patches and preferably the Baldurdash Fixpack.&nbsp; UB should work with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.
  <p>Listed below is an explanation of some of the mod's components:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
  <b>A. </b><a NAME="boo"></a><b>The Kidnapping of Boo, by Cliffette</b>
  <p>Minsc is by far one of the most colorful characters in the game.&nbsp; Many wonder, however, why he is one of the few NPCs who did not receive a quest.&nbsp; The answer--Bioware cut it before release.&nbsp; A shame actually, as his quest was particularly unique--Boo has been kidnapped!!!&nbsp; This particular component has been coded and scripted by Cliffette (using some of David Gaider's original quest dialog), and it is amazing.&nbsp; Minsc has never been so... um... Minsc-y ;).&nbsp; A separate <a HREF="readme_minsc_cut_quest.html" TARGET="_blank">readme</a> has been packaged for this quest.
  <p><b>B. <a NAME="suna"></a>The Suna Seni/Valygar Relationship Restoration</b>
  <p>Valygar got hit pretty hard when Bioware was forced to scrap many of its ideas.&nbsp; One of the more significant cuts was that of his relationship with Suna Seni.&nbsp; Since there are several Valygar romances in the works, we decided to stick to restoring his past, not his present.&nbsp; Hopefully this component will help give the sullen ranger a bit more personality.
  <p><b>C. <a NAME="kalah"></a>Kalah and What He Was Promised, by Andyr</b>
  <p>What was promised to Kalah, and who promised it to him?&nbsp; How did he suddenly acquire his powers?&nbsp; This mod small attempts to give a version of the answers.&nbsp; You need to not have done the circus tent quest for this to activate.&nbsp; The original quest proceeds as normal, though when you leave the circus tent afterwards the new section should proceed.&nbsp; It is a short addition, with several possible outcomes depending on your choices.
  <p><b>D. <a NAME="bodhihunt">Cat and Mouse: Bodhi hunts you in Spellhold, by Ghreyfain </b></a>
  <p>Presumably in an effort to tone down the difficulty level of BG2, certain components were cut, one in particular being Bodhi's threat to hunt down the player in his/her desperate escape from Spellhold. This component restores her behaviour, and she will appear after a given amount of time, which is set anywhere from several hours to 2 days, depending on difficulty level and player level. Special thanks go out to <a href="http://pocketplane.net/aoe">Ghreyfain</a> for writing and lending us this component.
  <p><b>E. <a NAME="gorje"></a>Gorje Hilldark and the Extended Illithium Quest</b>
  <p>Remember Unger Hilldark, the duergar who gave you the run-around while you were trying to find illithium for the temple?&nbsp; Well, as it turns out, Bioware originally had a different route for the player to take.&nbsp; Enter Gorje Hilldark, Unger's brother, who is trapped--somewhere--and holds the key to your illithium problem.&nbsp; If you thought Korgan was crass, wait until you meet this pair...
  <p><b>F. <a NAME="paina"></a>The Pai'Na/Spider's Bane Quest</b>
  <p>This component restores a quest that was cut by Bioware prior to the game's release.&nbsp; It offers an alternative method to appeasing Pai'Na, the drow hive master druid found in Bodhi's lair.
  <p><b>G. <a NAME="crane"></a>Restored Crooked Crane</b>
  <p>With the exception of the lich-in-the-wall, the Crooked Crane Inn has never been very worthwhile.&nbsp; Bioware seems to have had some plans for the inn, however.&nbsp; The two new gambler characters and a follow-up of the Aulava-Tiiro episode were not implemented due to a scripting mismatch.&nbsp; The inn is now restored to its original conception.
  <p><b>H. <a NAME="vampire"></a>Restored Encounters</b>
  <p>Originally, there were supposed to be two additional encounters with the warring thief guilds.&nbsp; The first features Shadow Thief Arkanis Gath, and the second delivers an appearance by Bodhi herself.&nbsp; Further research has turned up evidence of two other encounters, as well.&nbsp; One involves some muggers in the Slums, and the other spawns in Shadow Thieves if your reputation gets too low while in the Docks.
  <p>This component also restores the two encounters in the game with Hell Hounds.  One takes place in the Planar Sphere, and the other near the Cult of the Eyeless.
  <p>Finally, this component brings back Greyhand, an enigmatic character with a personal vendetta. CHARNAME is not the only one whose life has been affected by Jon Irenicus; Greyhand wants to take revenge by ensuring that Irenicus' plans will never come to fruition, no matter what that might involve...
  <p><b>I. <a NAME="artemis"></a>Artemis Entreri in Bodhi's Lair</b>
  <p>At some point, Bioware intended for Artemis Entreri to show up in Bodhi's Lair (the Chapter Six fight) if you have asked Drizzt &amp; Co. for assistance.  This component restores this scenario.  It has now been split into an optional component as some people would prefer Artemis to stay out of the game.  Furtheremore, there are other mods that restore this scenario.
  <p><b>J. <a NAME="xzar"></a>Corrected "Xzar's Creations"</b>
  <p>When you enter Prebek's home (Xzar's laboratory), you are greeted by several goblins.  Originally, however, it seems that, as a necromancer, you should be faced with two ghasts and a flesh golem.  So be it...
  <p><b>K. <a NAME="minions"></a>Restored Hell Minions, by SimDing0</b>
  <p>This component restores some of the aspects of the final fight with Irenicus that were present in the coding but unassigned. This includes restoring innate abilities to his demon minions, and allowing his mislead image to function correctly. The battle will become slightly harder as a result, but nowhere near the level of the Improved Irenicus component of the Tactics mod. Compatibility with this Tactics component is currently undetermined. Special thanks to
  </a><a href="http://pocketplane.net/sim">SimDing0</a> for his contribution of this component.
  <p><b>L. <a NAME="gorf"></a>Gorf the Squisher Fix, by Gebhard Blucher</b>
  <p>DEPRECATED.  BG2Fixpack has a superior version of this, and BG2EE already has this fix by default.
  <p><b>M. <a NAME="items"></a>Item Restorations</b>
  <p>This component will restore several items that never made it into the game.&nbsp; Some you may recognize from Baldur's Gate 1, while others are completely new.
  <p><b>N. <a NAME="yoshimo"></a>Yoshimo's Original Portrait</b>
  <p>Sometime during game production, Bioware dropped the original portrait for Yoshimo and developed a new one--the one that ships with the game currently.  This component will allow you to give him back his original, pre-release portrait, shown here:<br><br><img src="yoshimo/nyoshimm.bmp" alt="Yoshimo" />
  <p><b>O. <a NAME="anomen"></a>Anomen's Original Portrait</b>
  <p>Anomen was another NPC who had a portrait alteration prior to the game's release.  It has been rumored that this original portrait was changed to make him look a bit older--a bit rougher. The original is below:<br><br><img src="anomen/nanomenm.bmp" alt="Anomen" />
  <p><b>P. <a NAME="portrait"></a>NPC Portrait Restorations</b>
  <p>This component restores the portraits to the various NPCs found throughout the game.  Specifically, character portraits have now been restored to Coran, Safana, Faldorn, Garrick, Xzar, Tiax, and Quayle.
  <p><b>Q. <a NAME="bams"></a>Corrected BAMs and scripts</b>
  <p>DEPRECATED.  BG2Fixpack has a superior version of this, and BG2EE already has these fixes by default.
  <p><b>R. <a NAME="names"></a>Corrected Character Names</b>
  <p>This component restores creature names to various characters scattered across Amn.  Specifically, names have been restored for Crazyface, Korgan's old cohort; Derrick, the ranger; Malaaq, the genie; Hendron, Lady Delcia's Guard; Maheer, the Blacksmith; Hannah, the Circus attendant; and Lellyn, Mazzy's fallen compatriot.
  <p><b>S. <a NAME="dialogs"></a>Restored Minor Dialogs</b>
  <p>This component restores some rather minor dialog in the game.  Included are the feral halflings in the Planar Sphere and Anomen's commenting on Ajantis' death.  And a few other things - a fix meaning Charming Glaicas should always work, being able to give Simyaz back the Silver Sword in the Underdark, and one of Imoen's unassigned scripts.
  <p><b>T. <a NAME="powers">Restored Bhaalspawn Powers, by David Gaider</b></a>
  <p>Quote David Gaider: <i> "These are some extra Bhaalspawn abilities that the player was originally going to develop as he played out the challenges in the pocket plane, but they were cut in favor of the high-level abilities for all classes. There is a different set for good and evil, although many players are going to find that they get a mix of them. Perhaps the only negative is that it may be difficult to figure out what a couple of the powers do, as there is no way to get descriptions for special abilities (These can be found in the readme). For installation and uninstallation instructions view the
  <a href="http://www.planetbaldursgate.com/bg2/media/files/bhaalpowers_read_me.txt">readme</a>."</i>
  <p><b>U. <a NAME="tobitem"></a>Extended Throne of Bhaal Item Descriptions</b>
  <p>Due to &quot;word count limitations,&quot; Bioware was unable to include the complete descriptions for many items that show up in the Throne of Bhaal portion of the game.&nbsp; This component attempts to remedy that oversight.
  <p><b>V. <a NAME="tobminor"></a>Throne of Bhaal Minor Restorations</b>
  <p>As we work along, we occasionally come across small errors in the Throne of Bhaal portion of the game that we are able to fix.&nbsp; For the moment, they wil be condensed into the component.&nbsp; Presently, the only restoration is an oversight in Sarevok's scripting that prevented him from using a proper soundset.
  <p><b>W. <a NAME="justifier"></a>Justifier Kit, by Andyr</b>
  <p>The Justifier kit was one of two ranger kits that did not make it to the final release of the game.&nbsp; Thanks to <a href="mailto:andyr@gibberlings3.net">Andyr</a>, this omission has now been remedied.<p>The description of the Justifier kit is follows:<p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>JUSTIFIER: Some expeditions are so demanding and some foes so dangerous that they require the attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat skills far exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, and steely nerves places him in the first rank of elite warriors.<br>
  <br>
  For a determined Justifier no job is too difficult, no enemy too formidable. Their proficiency with weapons gives them an edge in combat, though the smaller time devoted to magical training leaves them slightly lacking in that department.<br>
  <br>
  They must be of Lawful Good alignmment.<br>
  <br>
  Advantages:<br>
  -  +10% to stealth ability<br>
  -  +1 to speed factor and thac0 per 10 levels<br>
  <br>
  Disadvantages:<br>
  -  No access to Charm Animal ability<br>
  -  Spell casting ability limited to:<br>
  Cure Light Wounds and Armour of Faith once each per day from level 8<br>
  Luck and Remove Fear once each per day from level 10<br>
  Draw Upon Holy Might once per day from level 12</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
  <p><b>X. <a NAME="feralan">Feralan Kit, by Andyr</b></a>
  <p>The second ranger kit that was omitted from the game's release, the Feralan kit can now
  be enjoyed by all, thanks to the hard work of <a href="mailto:andyr@gibberlings3.net">Andyr</a>.<p>The description of the Feralan kit is
  follows:<p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>FERALAN: What happens to children who wander in the wilderness and are never recovered? Or worse, those who are abandoned there? Many succumb to the dangers of the wild, but a fortunate few are taken in by animals, raised as a part of a lion`s brood, or a wolf`s litter. Cut off from civilization, they gradually take on the characteristics of the creatures who adopted them, forming some kind of unity with the spirit of the wild. In the process they become feralans, beings who combine the savagery of beasts with the intellect of man.<br>
        <br>
        Due to their wild nature, Feralans may not be of Lawful alignment. As Rangers, they are limited to Good alignments.<br>
        <br>
        Advantages:<br>
        -  +10% to Stealth ability<br>
        -  Gains +1 AC at first level, and a further bonus of +1 AC per 5 levels<br>
        -  May go into a Feral Rage once per day per 10 levels. The enraged state lasts for 60 seconds, and grants a bonus of +2 to hit, damage, and AC, and immunity to charm, hold and fear, maze, imprisonment, stun and sleep. He also gains 15 temporary hit points<br>
        -  May cast Call of the Wild once per day. This summons an animal companion who will fight for the caster for 3 rounds + 1 round/level. More powerful creatures are summoned at higher levels<br>
        <br>
        Disadvantages:<br>
        -  Becomes winded after Feral Rage. While he's winded he receives -2 to hit, -2 to damage and a +2 penalty to armor class.<br>
        -  Limited to one proficiency point in Bastard Sword, Long Sword, Short Sword, Two - Handed Sword, Katana, Scimitar, Halberd, Flail and Crossbow<br>
        -  May not wear any armour or use Large Shields<br>
        -  Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>&nbsp;
  <p>&nbsp;
  
  <p><b>Y. <a NAME="sarevok"></a>Sarevok's Remorse for Yoshimo and Tamoko, by Sovran and Winterine</b>
  <p>David Gaider "would have liked to see Sarevok confronted with the idea that not only was he responsible for Tamoko's death (and delve more into that), but Yoshimo's as well".  This component sheds some light on the link between Yoshimo, Tamoko, and Sarevok. In SoA, an extra dialogue between Yoshimo and Charname is added, as well as a small extension to Yoshimo's storyline.  In ToB, a dialogue between Charname and Sarevok explores presviously unresolved issues such as Tamoko’s *real* cause of death, which can -- and probably will -- also affect the possibility of Sarevok's redemption. [This is also one facet of the upcoming Sarevok Relationship mod.] If you start a new game in ToB but wish to assume you say the SoA part soon, then using the CLUAConsole to SetGlobal("U!SIlmater","GLOBAL",1) is all that's needed. This component requires ToB.</p>
  <p><b>Z. <a NAME="haer"></a>The Murder of Acton Balthis, by Kulyok</b>
  <p>Outlined and heavily detailed by David Gaider, this quest is now complete and available in v20 and above. In this adventure, three days after the Planar Prison's quest, Haer'Dalis gets arrested for a murder he has no idea about. It falls to the player to discover the clues leading to the true killer. To solve the murder, you will have to visit Acton Balthis' estate in the Bridge District, Chief Inspector Brega in the Government District, and repeatedly talk to Haer'Dalis in prison. You do not need to start a new game to play this component, however, (SPOILERS) if your party is out of Irenicus' Dungeon already, do not kill Quataris in the Promenade until he signs a confession.</p>

  <p><a NAME="install"><b>II. INSTALLATION</b></a>
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="i">Double-click the UnfinishedBusiness-v20.exe file and install to your main BG2 directory
    <li TYPE="i">Once the install program has finished, it will launce the WeiDU installer program.  Simply follow the on-screen
      instructions in the new DOS window.
  </ol>
  <p><b><i>MacOSX Installation Notes</b></i>
	<blockquote><blockquote>If you have previously installed this mod, you <b>must</b> uninstall it before installing the new version.  To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.  If properly extracted, you should have a "ub" folder, "setup-ub.tp2", "setup-ub", and "setup-ub.command" in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-ub.command" and follow the instructions on screen.</blockquote></blockquote>
  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp; We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches and (if not playing BG2EE) BG2 Fixpack.
  <p>If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please post the file SETUP-UB.DEBUG and Weidu.log
  on the <a href="http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/board,19.0.html">Pocket Plane forums</a>.

  <p><a NAME="compat"><b>IV. COMPATIBILITY</b></a>
  <p>Though we are striving to make Unfinished Business compatible with as many
  other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will
  arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="1&quot;">As per version 27, BG2Fixpack <i>must</i> be installed on non-EE games prior to installing Unfinished Business.  UB no longer contains any fixes of its own and may not work correctly without it!</li>
    <li TYPE="1&quot;">Version 24 and prior of Weimer's Ease of Use mod will cause conflicts if you install its Bonus Merchants component *after* installing Unfinished Business</li>
    <li TYPE="1&quot;">If you want to use Weimer's Tactics mod (v16 and prior only), be sure to install it *before* Unfinished Business. The City and Wilderness encounters of Tactics will intefere with some of UB's components</li>
    <li TYPE="1&quot;">A more detailed list of what is and what is not compatible with Unfinished Business can be seen <a href="http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/board,19.0.html">here</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="faqs"><b>V. FAQS</b></a>
  <p>Q: What do I need to use this mod?<br>
  A: Unfinished Business will require Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with the
  latest Bioware/Interplay patches. We also strongly encourage the installation
  of the Baldurdash Fixpack as well. Please refer to the links page for URLs of
  these items.
  <p>Q: Where did you find the information on these cut quests?<br>
  A: Most of our information came from scouring the 'net for any post made by
  David Gaider or other members of the Bioware BG2 design team. Some of the
  posts were sketchy, and we had to fill in the details, but hopefully our
  efforts are not that far off from the vision of the designers. The remainder
  of the information came from delving deep in the dialog and script files for
  the game. There are many remnants of creatures and conversations that hint at
  things that were planned, but never implemented.
  <p>Q: Will this mod add new quests to the Throne of Bhaal expansion?<br>
  A: Currently, no new content has been added to the Throne of Bhaal (ToB)
  portion of the game. There are several quests that were cut from ToB, and
  perhaps will be developed for future versions of the mod. Details about ToB
  cut components are a bit harder to find, so if you know of any, please post
  the details at the forum.
  <p>Q: Why did you decide to develop this mod?<br>
  A: The inspiration behind this mod's development springs from my borderline
  obsessive-compulsive desire for things to be complete... heh. Seriously,
  though, I was a bit frustrated after playing the game and seeing so many loose
  ends, as well as reading posts from the internet describing things that the
  developers had to cut due to time restraint. Coupled with my desire to learn
  how to write code, my inspiration turned into action, and the mod was born.
  <p>Q: Who is behind Unfinished Business's development?<br>
  A: The mod was started by myself, Erik Manning (a.k.a. icelus). Shortly after
  my announcement of the mod's entering production, Guillaume LeBlanc (a.k.a.
  Barren Fischa) joined the team as the self-proclaimed &quot;Crazed BG2
  Reasearcher.&quot; Following her desire to write the Minsc quest, Wendy Yung
  (a.k.a. Cliffette) also joined the team, adding her formidable conversation
  skills. Andyr helped with the Kalah component in an early version and more
  recently provided the Feralan and Justifier, and has taken over as project 
  manager and maintainer. Also of note are the many beta testers and forum
  members who have given much inspiration, information, and consideration to
  this project.
  <p>Q: What items have been restored with this mod?<br>
  A: There were actually less than we initially believed, but as of the current
  release, the restored items are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>Boots of the West
    <li>Boots of Hastened Departure
    <li>Gloves of Missile Snaring
    <li>Shazzellim, Scimitar +1
    <li>Taragarth, Bastard Sword +1
    <li>Wolfskin Bag
    <li>Websack Wand
    <li>Wraithform spell
  </ul>
  In addition, in non-EE games a dummied-out import function has been restored, which will give the player one of the following items in Irenicus' dungeon:
  <ul>
    <li>Varcona, Long Sword +2
    <li>Bala's Axe
    <li>Krotan's Skullcrusher, Mace +2
    <li>Surya's Blade, Halberd +2
  </ul>
  BG2EE already has a fancier version of this built in, which can get the player an even greater selection of BG1 items.
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="spoilers"><b>VI. SPOILERS</b></a>
  <p>Not many at the moment... Minsc-specific spoilers are found in the packaged
  Minsc file.
  <p>Q: Why isn't Valygar in his cabin?<br>
  A: Valygar will only appear in his cabin if you have followed one of the two paths to find him. Seek out Suna Seni or Llarsh the tax collector.
  <p>Q: Where is Unger's lost brother, Gorje, hiding?<br>
  A: Lost in Shadow, I'm afraid. Perhaps the Sun will light your way...
  <p>Q: No, really... where is Gorje?!?<br>
  A: Try the Temple of Amaunator.
  <p>Q: Where can I find the Restored Items?<br>
  A: We tried to place the items in places that made at least a little sense.
  None of them should be too difficult to find. Nevertheless, here is the list:
  <ul>
    <li>Boots of the West: Given to Derrick, the ranger outside Valygar's Cabin
    <li>Boots of Hastened Departure: On the body of Greyhand, *if* the Restored Encounters component is installed
    <li>Gloves of Missile Snaring: On one of the Shadow Thief assassins near the end of Irenicus' dungeon
    <li>Shazzellim, Scimitar +1: In the home of Prebek -a notable Zhent- in the
      Docks District
    <li>Taragarth, Bastard Sword +1: In the ranger cabin in the Umar Hills

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHANGES</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Revert Crooked Crane script to its old illogical name, for compatibility-friendliness.</li>
    <li>More systematic awareness of the BG2Fixpack: components that overlap with the Fixpack are not installed if the Fixpack is present.</li>
    <li>"Readme" and "Version" flags added to TP2.  </li>
    <li>By popular demand (and using Andyr's online comment to justify it), the excursion to the Troll Mound is removed from the Kidnapping of Boo,
    and we revert to the old version.</li>
    <li>Restored Minor Dialogues now uses strings already in the dialog.tlk wherever possible, which should help for translation.</li>
    <li>Added Italian translation by Giuseppe Cali.</li>
    <li>Updated WeiDU to 210.</li>
    <li>Well, since you ask so nicely... -DW</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BUGFIXES</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Systematic TP2 cleanup, courtesy of Nythrun.</li>
    <li>Arbane's Sword is now given to Eldarin in the "Suna Seni" component, not the "Item restoration" component - this prevents situations where
    there are two copies of it.</li>
    <li>Minsc can no longer get multiple THAC0 bonuses when he gets Boo back.</li>
    <li>SimDing0's "restored hell minions" no longer turns the Balors into Pit Fiends. This was breaking compatibility with lots of mods that enforce
    Blood War tanarri-baatezu conflicts, including some of Sim's own. (This is purely cosmetic: all that's changed is name, animation and alignment.)
    <li>[The infamous "unkillable trolls" bug is fixed by default by the reversion of the Kidnapping quest to its old form]
  </ul>
